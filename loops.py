# for i in range(1, 12):
#     print(i, "*", num, "=", i * num)

# a = 1 * 4
# print(a)

# Q1. Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number using for loop. 
# num = 12
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(f"{i} X {num} = {num*i}")


# 2. Write a program to greet all the person names stored in a list ‘l’ and which starts with S. 
# l = ["Harry", "Soham", "Sachin", "Rahul"];
# for i in l:
#     if(i.startswith("S")):
#         print(f"Hello {i}")

# 3. Attempt problem 1 using while loop. 
# num = 12
# i = 1
# while(i < 11):
#     print(f"{num} X {i} = {num*i}")
#     i+=1

# 4. Write a program to find whether a given number is prime or not. 
# num = int(input("Enter number: "))
# for i in range(2, num):
#     if(num%i) == 0:
#         print("It is not a prime number")
#         break
# else:
#     print("It is a prime number")

# 5. Write a program to find the sum of first n natural numbers using while loop. 
# num = int(input("Enter Number: "))
# i = 1
# sum = 0

# while(i<=num):
#     sum+=i
#     i+=1
# print(sum)

# 6. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using for loop. 


# 7. Write a program to print the following star pattern. 
#   * 
#  *** 
# ***** for n = 3 


# 8. Write a program to print the following star pattern: 
# * 
# ** 
# ***      for n = 3 


# 9. Write a program to print the following star pattern. 
# * * * 
# *   *   for n = 3 
# * * *  


# 10. Write a program to print multiplication table of n using for loops in reversed order.
