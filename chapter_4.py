# Lists in Python
# Lists are mutable
# If you want to store the record of same kind of elements, so you can use the list
# Lists are created with square brackets like []
# like
fruits = ["Apple", "Mango", "Orange", "Pineapple", "Blueberry"]
# you can mute it like
fruits[2] = "Guava"
print(fruits[2])

# You can access its elements as same as strings
print(fruits[1:3])

# .insert - it inserts an element on the given array
# .pop - it deletes a particular element at given element and (returns it on print)
# .remove - it removes the value
